Problem 3: Using Selenium and Python to create a file

Modify selenium2github.py from lecture11 to create a file containing your own message using Selenium.

Replace the github account name and password with your own.

The file that you create has to be named differently from the ones created in problems 1 and 2.

Use the same naming convention having your last name embedded [last_name]_file3.txt, like:

lam_file3.txt
